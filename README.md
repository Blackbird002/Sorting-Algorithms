# Sorting-Algorithms
Various sorting algorithms that I have encountered in Computer Science

# BubbleSort
The simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order (aka sinking sort).
<br>
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)

# SelectionSort
A sorting algorithm (aka in-place comparison sort). Algorithm divides the input into two parts: a sub-list of items already sorted and a sub-list of items remaining to be sorted.
<br>
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)

# InsertionSort
A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array/list one item at a time. 
<br>
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)

# CountingSort
Uses supplied information about the range of numbers from 0 to k in the array. 
It determines for each element in the array x, the number of elements that are less than x.
It then uses that information to place the element x directly into position in array.
<br>
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n + k)
