# Sorting-Algorithms
Various sorting algorithms that I have encountered in Computer Science

# BubbleSort
The simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order (aka sinking sort).
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)

# SelectionSort
A sorting algorithm (aka in-place comparison sort). Algorithm divides the input into two parts: a sub-list of items already sorted and a sub-list of items remaining to be sorted.
<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(n^2)
